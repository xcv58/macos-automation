# SD Import Manual QA Matrix

Use this checklist before major public releases and whenever scanner/import
behavior changes.

A focused physical-card pass is available for source ejection from a built-in
SD reader. Broader camera and failure-path coverage still relies on fixtures and
the remaining hardware matrix below.

Release decision for this pass:

- Focused built-in-reader passes are complete for manual ejection after an
  error-free import and after a zero-copy scan.
- Physical Sony/Canon/Fujifilm/Nikon compatibility QA remains unavailable.
- Fixture coverage exists for common RAW extensions, RAW/JPEG pairing, sidecar
  handling, duplicate filename planning, and card-removal failure paths.
- Broad camera-compatibility claims should wait until the hardware matrix below
  is actually run.
- The capture script is ready for future physical-card evidence.

Use the capture script for each mounted card before filling in the manual app
results:

```bash
./script/capture_manual_card_qa.sh \
  --volume /Volumes/CARD \
  --scenario "Canon photo card" \
  --output /tmp/sdimport-canon-photo-card-qa.md
```

The capture report omits filenames and full paths. Review it before sharing or
committing any excerpt.

## Required Hardware Passes

| Scenario | Card Contents | Expected Result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sony video card | `PRIVATE/M4ROOT`, MP4/MOV clips, `MEDIAPRO.XML`, `DATABASE.BIN`, sidecars | Index files ignored; footage backup recommended; sidecars visible and opt-in | Accepted risk: hardware unavailable; fixture coverage exists for index-file ignore and sidecar behavior |
| Canon photo card | JPEG plus CR2 and CR3 files | Photo import recommended; CR2/CR3 classified as photos; RAW/JPEG pairs summarized when basenames match | Accepted risk: hardware unavailable; fixture coverage exists |
| Fujifilm photo card | RAF plus JPEG files | Photo import recommended; RAF classified as photo; known files skipped on rescan | Accepted risk: hardware unavailable; fixture coverage exists |
| Nikon photo card | NEF plus JPEG files | Photo import recommended; NEF classified as photo; known files skipped on rescan | Accepted risk: hardware unavailable; fixture coverage exists |
| Mixed RAW/JPEG | Matching RAW and JPEG basenames in the same folder | RAW+JPEG pair count appears; both files remain importable | Fixture coverage exists; hardware unavailable |
| Video sidecars | Video clips with XML/metadata/proxy files | Footage Backup shows sidecar count; sidecars stay skipped unless kept | Fixture coverage exists; hardware unavailable |
| Duplicate filenames | Two camera folders containing the same clip filename | Destination plan suffixes later copies and avoids overwrites | Fixture coverage exists; hardware unavailable |
| Card removal during scan | Remove card after scan starts | User-facing failure; no duplicate job loop | Fixture coverage exists; hardware unavailable |
| Card removal during import | Remove card during copy | Failed file recorded; retry remains available | Fixture coverage exists; hardware unavailable |
| Manual source eject | Complete an error-free import, then choose the named eject action on the receipt | The whole source volume unmounts; the receipt says `Ejected — Safe to Remove`; destination files remain accessible | Passed 2026-07-22: 11 of 11 files (200.1 MB) copied, then the built-in-reader source ejected |
| Automatic source eject | Enable `Eject source device after a successful import`, then complete an error-free import | The verified removable source device ejects only after the receipt and report are finalized | Required before releasing source ejection |
| Multi-volume camera detection | Connect a camera that exposes internal storage and a memory card as separate disks | Both volumes are direct, one-click source choices labeled with the same physical device | Topology confirmed 2026-07-25 with DJI Pocket hardware: `Untitled` on one whole disk and `Pocket4` on a second whole disk share one DJI USB-device registry identity |
| Multi-volume camera eject | Import from either storage volume, then choose the device eject action | Every whole disk belonging to the verified physical device unmounts before the UI says the camera is safe to disconnect | Grouped manual eject passed 2026-07-25; the post-import receipt path was not separately exercised on multi-volume hardware |
| Partial multi-volume eject failure | Keep one camera volume busy, then eject the grouped device | No force-eject occurs; the app identifies any volume already ejected and the volume that remains mounted | Fixture coverage required; confirm with hardware when practical |
| Eject blocked by another app | Keep a source file open in another app, then request ejection | macOS refusal is shown in SD Import; the source remains mounted; no force-eject occurs | Required before releasing source ejection |
| Import completed with errors | Enable automatic ejection, then produce a retryable copy failure | The source remains mounted and retry stays available | Fixture policy coverage exists; confirm with hardware before release |
| Source subfolder | Select a folder inside the mounted card as the source, import, then eject | SD Import ejects the card's volume root rather than only the selected folder | Fixture policy coverage exists; confirm with hardware before release |
| Built-in card reader | Import from a card that macOS reports as both internal-location and removable | The verified removable card remains eligible and ejects normally | Passed 2026-07-22 with a removable Secure Digital source reported at an internal device location |
| Ejection completion UI | Complete a clean import, then eject from the copy receipt | The named source has a prominent eject action; success changes to a green `Ejected — Safe to Remove` confirmation | Passed 2026-07-22 with source `Untitled` |
| Zero-copy scan ejection | Scan a verified removable card whose files are all known or excluded | The Source panel offers manual ejection; automatic ejection does not run | Passed 2026-07-22: user confirmed the manual zero-copy eject flow; automatic ejection was not exercised |
| Skip-copy scan ejection | Scan a verified removable source with files available to copy, then choose eject instead of import | The Source panel keeps manual ejection available beside `Scan Again`, copies no files, and automatic ejection does not run | Passed 2026-07-25 with DJI Pocket hardware: user confirmed the persistent Source-panel eject action worked without starting the copy |
| Clean Mac user | Fresh user account, no prior settings | Onboarding appears; folders can be selected; Sparkle menu appears in release build | Accepted risk: clean-user manual pass unavailable |
| Auto-prompt upgrade | Enable mount prompting in the previous public release, update through Sparkle, then mount one importable card while the app is closed | The updated helper build matches the app, Settings reports Running without toggling, and one visible prompt appears without opening the app manually | Accepted risk for the 2.5 (41) candidate on 2026-08-02: the original field failure cannot be reproduced locally and a physical old-to-new pass is unavailable. Automated coverage verifies helper identity/build repair, scheduled missing/nonlaunching-helper retries, stale-agent rejection, durable occurrence-identified handoff retry, causal health errors, atomic stale-copy preference preservation, and process-lifetime closed-window presentation. Ask the affected user to confirm after release; retain this as a required gate for future background-prompt releases when suitable hardware is available. |
| Auto-prompt hidden app | Hide or minimize SD Import, then mount one importable card | The existing main window activates and presents exactly one prompt | Required before releasing background-prompt changes |
| Auto-prompt closed window | Close the last SD Import main window without quitting, then mount one importable card | SD Import creates a new main window and presents exactly one prompt without a second manual launch | Required before releasing background-prompt changes |
| Auto-prompt approval repair | Disable SD Import in System Settings Login Items while the saved preference remains enabled | Settings shows Needs approval and opens the correct Login Items pane; reapproval restores Running without toggling twice | Required before releasing background-prompt changes |
| Auto-prompt missing registration | Leave the saved preference enabled, unregister the helper, then relaunch SD Import | The bundled helper is registered again once for the current build; Settings returns to Running without toggling the preference | Required before releasing background-prompt changes |
| Auto-prompt active retry | Leave the installed app active with the saved preference enabled, force the helper into missing or nonlaunching state, and do not close/reopen the app | Registration or helper repair retries after the bounded cooldown and returns to Running without another activation or preference toggle | Automated retry scheduler and causal policy coverage exists; physical validation required for a future background-prompt release |
| Auto-prompt same-build re-enable | Disable and re-enable mount prompting without changing the app build, then prevent the newly registered helper from launching | Settings does not reuse the earlier launch record as proof of health; the nonlaunching-helper repair starts after the bounded health timeout | Automated precise launch-epoch coverage includes a pre-attempt launch in the same wall-clock second; physical validation required for a future background-prompt release |
| Auto-prompt retry cooldown across activation | Force `.notFound` or `.notRegistered`, let an explicit enable, manual repair, or reconciliation registration attempt fail, then repeatedly reactivate the app during the cooldown | No entry point or activation bypasses the persisted cooldown; one retry is attempted when the bounded delay expires | Automated missing-registration policy coverage exists; physical validation required for a future background-prompt release |
| Auto-prompt same-path card swap | Keep an import or prompt active, mount one card at `/Volumes/CARD`, replace it with another card that reuses that path, then finish the blocking work | The durable mailbox retains two occurrence IDs; the current mounted card receives a prompt and cross-origin observations are coalesced only when their volume UUID matches | Automated durable-queue, one-to-one cross-origin correlation, and post-media-probe UUID revalidation coverage exists; physical validation required for a future background-prompt release |
| Auto-prompt multiple app copies | Keep an older same-build or previous-build copy running outside `/Applications`, install the current copy in `/Applications`, then try the toggle and mount one importable card | The uninstalled copy says `Managed by installed copy`, cannot mutate the helper, and only the authoritative installed copy activates with exactly one prompt | Required before releasing background-prompt changes |
| Auto-prompt stale-copy settings save | Open an uninstalled copy before enabling prompting in the installed copy, then change an unrelated path or theme in the stale copy | The unrelated setting saves, but the installed copy's shared auto-prompt preference remains enabled | Automated atomic two-writer repository coverage exists; physical validation required for a future background-prompt release |
| Auto-prompt installation authority | Test copies in `/Applications`, `~/Applications`, Downloads, and a mounted DMG, including a renamed installed copy | `/Applications/SD Import.app` wins deterministically, then another matching app in `/Applications`, then `~/Applications`; an uninstalled-only copy says `Install required` | Required before releasing background-prompt changes |
| Auto-prompt causal errors | Queue an older successful handoff, then force a newer helper launch or mailbox failure before the old event is acknowledged | The newer error remains visible until a later event succeeds; the older acknowledgement does not erase it | Required before releasing background-prompt changes |

## Recorded Ejection Evidence

- Date: 2026-07-22.
- Build: SD Import 2.2 (31), local ad-hoc test build.
- Reader: built-in Secure Digital reader; macOS reported the removable card at
  an internal device location.
- Source: `Untitled`, 512.64 GB capacity.
- Successful-import pass: 11 of 11 files copied, 200.1 MB total, zero failures;
  the named manual eject action unmounted the source and showed the safe-removal
  confirmation.
- Date: 2026-07-25.
- Build: SD Import 2.3 (39), local ad-hoc test build.
- Device: DJI Pocket camera exposing `Pocket4` and `Untitled` as separate whole
  disks under one USB-device identity.
- Multi-volume manual pass: both storage volumes appeared as direct source
  choices; the grouped source action ejected the physical device without
  starting the available copy. The post-import receipt path was not separately
  exercised on this hardware.
- Zero-copy pass: the user confirmed that a completed scan with zero files
  planned for copying offered manual ejection and successfully ejected the
  source.
- Not recorded for this pass: macOS version, Mac model, card brand, filesystem,
  automatic ejection, blocked ejection, copy-failure behavior, and source
  subfolder behavior.

## Evidence To Record

For each hardware pass, record:

- SD Import version and build.
- macOS version and Mac model.
- Camera/card brand and reader type.
- Filesystem, usually exFAT or FAT32.
- Whether import was automatic or manual.
- Preview counts: new, known, sidecars, conflicts.
- Final result: imported, skipped, failed.
- Any diagnostics export or crash report path, if relevant.
- The redacted output from `script/capture_manual_card_qa.sh`, if useful.

Do not commit private media, full card dumps, private filenames, or unredacted
diagnostics.
